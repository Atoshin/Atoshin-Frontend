                    sending a full response if the content has not changed. This speeds up website performance because

                physical, and administrative security measures to prevent the risk of your information being lost,
                misused, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification. To protect the information we collect, we
                have implemented adequate physical, technological, and administrative safeguards. All of the information
                you send to us is kept on our secure servers, which are protected by firewalls. We encrypt the transfer
                of extremely sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through the Services using Secure
                Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
                You are also responsible for the safety and security of your data. You are responsible for keeping your
