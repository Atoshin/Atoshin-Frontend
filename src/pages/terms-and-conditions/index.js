                What is the definition of ATOSHIN?
            </div>
            <div className={classes.paragraph}>
                ATOSHIN is a platform that allows Museums, Permanent collection and artists (&quot;Creators&quot;) and
                collectors (&quot;Collectors&quot;) to sell, buy, list for auction, make offers, and bid on Non-fungible
                tokens(NFTs) for Physical arts and collectibles, digital art that is represented by non-fungible
                Ethereum-based tokens (&ldquo;Physical Assets&rdquo; &amp; &quot;Digital Artwork&quot;). Smart-Contract
                Supporting the NFTs on ATOSHIN is represented on the Ethereum blockchain through smart contracts, which
                offer an immutable ledger of all ATOSHIN transactions (&quot;Smart Contracts&quot;). This means that all
                Physical Assets and Digital Artwork is uncontrollable by any single entity, including ATOSHIN, and is
                susceptible to several dangers and uncertainties. MetaMask, Coinbase, the Ethereum network, your
                browser, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you could access, visit, or utilize to
                enable you to enjoy the Platform&apos;s different features are not owned or controlled by us. We will
                not be

                third parties, nor will we be liable for any acts or omissions of such third parties. The User
                acknowledges that every time you engage in a transaction on the Platform, your Ethereum public address

                While ATOSHIN provides a NFT for Physical Assets and digital art marketplace, it does not buy, sell, or
                otherwise take custody or possession of any Physical or digital art. The Platform makes it easier for
                Users to acquire NFTs for Physical Assets or Digital Artwork, but neither the NEEI LLC, nor the Platform
                are responsible for any Physical Asset or Digital Artwork. The User recognizes and accepts that the
                Smart Contracts do not give the ATOSHIN custody, possession, or control of any Physical Asset or Digital
                Artwork or cryptocurrency at any time for the purpose of conducting Platform transactions. You confirm
                that you are aware and acknowledge that ATOSHIN is a non-custodial service provider who has built this

                certain result as a result of listing their NFTs for Physical Assets or Digital Artwork on ATOSHIN.

                are still in &quot;beta&quot; version (&quot;Beta Platforms&quot;). By designating Beta Platforms on its

                provision of these Terms of Service to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to
                give effect to the parties&apos; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the remaining provisions of

                Platform or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year of the day the claim or cause of

                    Dispute Resolution Procedures The arbitration shall be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
                    accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;),
                    including
                    the AAA&apos;s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;), as amended by this
                    Arbitration
                    Agreement. Visit the AAA&apos;s website at http://www.adr.org for further information. The AAA&apos;s consumer
                    arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/, contains information regarding the AAA Rules and costs for
                    consumer disputes, which may be changed from time to time. If any term of the AAA Rules conflicts
                    with a term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will
                    take precedence unless the arbitrator determines that applying the contradictory Arbitration
                    Agreement terms would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration. In the same way as a court
                    would, the arbitrator must observe the provisions of these Terms of Service. All questions,
                    including but not limited to matters relating to the scope, enforcement, and arbitrability of this
                    Arbitration Agreement, are for the arbitrator to decide. Although arbitration hearings are typically
                    less formal and time-consuming than trials and other judicial proceedings, an arbitrator can award
                    the same damages and relief to an individual as a court can under the Terms of Service and
                    applicable legislation. Arbitrator decisions are enforceable in court and can only be overturned by
                    a court for very specific grounds.
                    Unless ATOSHIN and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will be held at a location that is
                    fairly convenient for both parties, taking into account their capacity to travel and other relevant
                    factors. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA will make the decision. If your claim
                    is for $10,000 or less, ATOSHIN undertakes to let you select whether the arbitration will be
                    conducted purely on the basis of papers presented to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing,
                    or through an in-person hearing, as set forth in the AAA Rules. If your claim is worth more than
                    $10,000, the AAA Rules will assess whether you have a right to a hearing. The arbitrator must give a
                    reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the fundamental findings and conclusions on which
                    the award is based, regardless of how the arbitration is conducted.

                Unless otherwise specified in this Arbitration Agreement, all filing, administration, and arbitrator

                    For the advantage of all parties, all aspects of the arbitration proceeding, as well as any ruling,
                    decision, or award made by the arbitrator, will be kept totally confidential.

                    Severability
                    If a court or arbitrator rules that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid
                    or unenforceable (other than subsection (b) above titled &quot;Prohibition of Class and
                    Representative
                    Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot;), the parties agree to replace it with a term or
                    provision
                    that is valid and enforceable and comes closest to expressing the invalid or unenforceable term or
                    provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be void. If any of the provisions of subsection (b)
                    above titled &quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
                    Relief&quot; are
                    found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, then the entire Arbitration Agreement
                    will be null and void, unless such provisions are found to be invalid or unenforceable solely with
                    respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The rest of the Terms of Service will remain in
                    effect.
